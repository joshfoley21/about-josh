    <p>I am 23 years old and was born in Roswell but moved to Rio Rancho at a young age, I love outdoor activities such as skiing and fishing.</p>
    <p>I have played sports most of my life and just finished playing football at The University of New Mexico where I also graduated with a bachelors degree.</p>
    <p>I have 2 older brothers and 1 younger sister, my sister is engaged and is getting married next September.</p>
    <p>I have a lot going on right now in my life such as a career change I am very excited for.</p>
    <p>My oldest brother and his girlfriend are pregnant with their first child, we already found out it is going to a boy!</p>
